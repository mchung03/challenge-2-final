# challenge-2-final

## Description

This project is a portfolio that will hold the links to all my future projects. It solves the problem of having an unappealing, confusing list of projects on a Google Docs, and instead presenting them through photos, which are linked to the project website. I learned how to build a website from scratch using HTML and CSS, as well as how to deploy a site.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To use this website, click an option on the navigation bar and it will drop down to the relevant section.

Click on an image to view the project website. (The placeholder images will take you to google.com for now because we haven't made many projects yet)

Clicking on the phone number will dial the number. Clicking on the email sends you to a link that allows you to send an email right away. Clicking on the GitHub link directs you to my GitHub repositories.
